# ðŸ”§ Agent Setup Guide

Your Streamlit app is working! The demo mode shows it's ready for configuration.

## Current Status: âœ… Demo Mode Active

The app shows helpful demo responses while you configure the real agent connection.

## ðŸš€ To Connect Your Real Agent:

### Step 1: Find Your Agent Location
Run this in Snowflake to find your agent:
```sql
SHOW AGENTS;
-- Look for your FETII_CHAT agent and note the database/schema
```

### Step 2: Update the Code
In `streamlit_app.py` around **line 207**, replace:
```python
agent_endpoint = f"{base_url}/api/v2/databases/YOUR_DATABASE/schemas/YOUR_SCHEMA/agents/FETII_CHAT/agent:run"
```

With your actual locations:
```python
agent_endpoint = f"{base_url}/api/v2/databases/MY_DB/schemas/MY_SCHEMA/agents/FETII_CHAT/agent:run"
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
```bash
snow streamlit deploy --replace
```

## âœ… Issues Fixed:
- **Account URL quotes** - Removed extra quotes causing connection errors
- **Demo mode** - Provides helpful responses while you configure
- **Better error handling** - Shows current database/schema info
- **Timeout added** - Prevents hanging connections

Your app will work immediately with demo responses, then connect to real data once configured! ðŸŽ¯
